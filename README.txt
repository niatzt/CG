The story is that the leading charater, chopper (in 'one piece' animation), likes mushroom very much. After eating the third mushroom, a trigger for treasure map is activated accidently and the map is shown on the wall. At last, Chopper shows his happy face!
----------------------------------------------
1. two level hierarchical object -- I draw chooper's arm and leg using a hierarchical structure with flat shading(see subroutine chopper in "main.cpp")
2. the floor and wall use mapped texture
3. camera fly around at the very beginning
4. mushroom is my polygonal object with smooth shading (mushroom.cpp)
-----------------------------------------------
5. display frame rate -- cannot make it
